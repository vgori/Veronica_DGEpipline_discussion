[2020-02-01 14:59:59.242] [jointLog] [info] Computed 1,842 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-02-01 14:59:59.242] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3,000 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-02-01 14:59:59.256] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3000 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
